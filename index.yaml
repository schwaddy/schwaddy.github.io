    Holy cow. I sit here traipsing the caves and passageways of this brand-new-yet-somehow-ancient underbelly.
    Perhaps I'm tapping ancient structures, idioms, or maybe it's all beautiful and brand new. I'm not sure.

    Ah yes, can we believe it? After years of research and RnD, we have a Hobix! My only concern is that we did not properly evaluate it for risk of, say, the singularity. Ah well, it's just a feature not a bug,  right?
